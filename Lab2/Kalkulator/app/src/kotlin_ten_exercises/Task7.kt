/**
 * You have a program that counts pizza slices until thereâ€™s a whole pizza with 8 slices. Refactor this program in two ways:
 * - Use a while loop.
 * - Use a do-while loop.
 *
 * fun main() {
 *  var pizzaSlices = 0
 *  // Start refactoring here
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  println("There's only $pizzaSlices slice/s of pizza :(")
 *  pizzaSlices++
 *  // End refactoring here
 *  println("There are $pizzaSlices slices of pizza. Hooray! We have a whole pizza! :D")
